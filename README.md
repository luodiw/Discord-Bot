## Discord bot template

A discord bot template to use for your server and speed up your bot development.

## üöÄ Features

- Easily make any type of bot based on a modular structure.
- Simple code organization based on components.
- Docker and Pipenv support inbuilt to make the deployment and development workflow efficient.
- Cogs have auto loaders for adding it quickly without manually. 
- Pre added `owner` cog, Help command and Error handler focusing on functionality.
- Inbuilt logging support.

## Requirements

- Python [3.7 or above] 
- Git
- Pipenv [Python package for virtual envs] - Install it using `pip install pipenv`

## Quickstart

In these steps,
- Use this template by clicking **use this template** button in the top right side and make a repository 
  of your own, or Clone the repo, whichever feels better.
- You need to have either docker with docker-compose or Python with Pipenv (Mentioned above) to run 
  this project.
- Create a discord bot in the [Discord developer panel](https://discord.com/developers/applications), Ignore this if done.
- Configure the environmental variables by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env` with the respective 
  values.
- Here are the commands to quickly get it working:
  - **Docker**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build --env-file .env
    ```
  - **Python with Pipenv**
    ```sh
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv sync -d
    pipenv run start
    ```
## Project and code structure information

- Autoloader: The project comes with an autoloader for cogs, that finds all the 
directories / files which have a `setup` attribute and loads them. You can have a `__init__.py`
to load all of them, as the core cog, or have a file with a setup function.

- `core/` Directory is preserved for keeping important things for your bot, such as
converters, decorators and other tools which are really necessary.

- `utils/` directory has several utility functions to make the experience better and work less
  when making the bot. It has things like `EmbedPages` for pagination, `humanize_time` to
  convert timedeltas into huma readable format and more!

- `config.py` contains the configuration and attributes for the bot to use to run and display 
in commands.

- `__main__.py` is present for initializing and running the bot.

- `__init__.py` contains the subclass of the bot with custom features

- The bot comes with a customized error handler, help command, and owners only command.

- There is logging setup all over the bot, which you can also use too when developing it.
You need to import the logger, `from loguru import logger` and just start logging without hassle!

- Global session: Sometimes you need to use `aiohttp` for fetching from the web, and people usually
forget closing it. I added a global session that can be used anywhere using the `self.bot.session` attribute
and it's opening and closing is handled in the subclass.

- Docker information: There is docker compose for multiple containers and services, like postgres, lavalink and 
more. If you need help you can contact. There is also a script for waiting for services that makes life easier too.
Customize it according to the services you use, and the waiting needed for it.

## Creating the bot on Discord

1. Create bot on Discord's [bot portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. Make a **New Application**
3. Go to **Bot** settings and click on **Add Bot**
4. Give **Administrator** permission to bot
5. You will find your bot **TOKEN** there, it is important that you save it
6. Go to **OAuth2** and click bot, than add **Administrator** permissions
7. Follow the link that will appear to add the bot to your discord server

## Installation

Guide to self host the bot, and privately use it to simplify work. 

## Docker

Docker is an easy way of containerizing and delivering your applications quickly and easily, in an 
convenient way. It's really simple to get started with this, with docker handling all the installation
and other tasks. Configure the environmental variables by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env` with the respective values.
values. Then, run `docker-compose --env-file .env up` after getting the project and config ready.

**Docker mini guide:**

- Running the bot: `docker-compose up --build`
- Stopping the bot: `docker-compose down`
- Rebuilding the bot: `docker-compose build`

### Self hosting without docker

This is a clean and neat way of hosting without using docker. Follow this if docker doesn't work
well on your system, or it doesn't support it. Containers are resource intensive, and your PC might not
be able to do it, this is the perfect method to get started with the self-hosting.

- Clone or fork the repository, whichever suits you better.
- Install `pipenv`, a virtual env for python. Command: **`pip install pipenv`**
- Create the virtual environment and prepare it for usage using `pipenv update`
- Configure the environmental variables by renaming the `.env.example` file to `.env` with the respective 
  values for it. If you're using heroku or other platforms that have option for external environmental
  variables, use that instead of `.env`
- Configure the options and settings available in `config.py` inside the Bot module, according to your
  preferences.
- Run the server using `pipenv run start`
